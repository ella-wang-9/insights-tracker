# Folder Upload Test Results

## Summary
The folder upload functionality is implemented correctly in the UI and backend:

### Frontend Implementation ✅
- **Input Type Selector**: Users can select "Folder" as input type
- **Folder Selection**: Native OS folder picker dialog opens when clicking "Select Folder"
- **File Filtering**: Only .txt and .docx files are processed from selected folders
- **File Count Display**: Shows "X files selected" after folder selection
- **Multiple Files Support**: All filtered files are sent to backend for processing

### Backend Implementation ✅
- **Endpoint**: `/api/batch/analyze-all-with-preview` handles folder uploads
- **Concurrent Processing**: Files are processed in batches for performance
- **Mixed Input Support**: Can handle files, text, and URLs in same batch
- **Error Handling**: Individual file failures don't block entire batch

### Key Code Components

1. **Folder Selection Handler** (BatchAnalysis.tsx):
```typescript
const handleFolderSelect = (id: string, files: FileList | null) => {
  if (files && files.length > 0) {
    const supportedFiles = Array.from(files).filter(file => 
      file.name.endsWith('.txt') || file.name.endsWith('.docx')
    );
    
    if (supportedFiles.length > 0) {
      updateInput(id, { 
        files: supportedFiles,
        filenames: supportedFiles.map(f => f.name),
        content: `${supportedFiles.length} files selected`
      });
    }
  }
};
```

2. **Folder Input UI**:
```jsx
{input.type === 'folder' && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Input
      type="file"
      // @ts-ignore - webkitdirectory is not in React types
      webkitdirectory=""
      directory=""
      multiple
      onChange={(e) => handleFolderSelect(input.id, e.target.files)}
      className="flex-1"
      accept=".txt,.docx"
    />
    <Button
      type="button"
      variant="outline"
      size="icon"
      onClick={() => {
        const input = document.querySelector(`input[type="file"]`) as HTMLInputElement;
        input?.click();
      }}
    >
      <FolderOpen className="h-4 w-4" />
    </Button>
  </div>
)}
```

3. **Batch Processing**: All files from folder are sent as FormData to backend

### Current Status
- ✅ UI correctly displays folder selection option
- ✅ Folder picker works and filters files appropriately  
- ✅ Selected files are shown in UI
- ✅ Files are sent to backend for processing
- ⚠️ LLM endpoints are experiencing timeouts affecting processing speed
- ✅ When LLM works, fields are correctly populated with extracted insights

### Test Results
When testing with a folder containing multiple .txt files:
- Customer names are extracted correctly
- Product mentions are identified
- Industries are inferred from context
- Use cases are properly categorized
- Results can be exported to Excel/CSV

The folder upload functionality is working as designed. The only issue is with LLM endpoint availability, which affects all processing (not just folder uploads).
