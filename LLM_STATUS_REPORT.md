# LLM Performance Status Report

## Summary
The LLM endpoints are experiencing severe performance issues due to rate limiting and high demand. Documents are taking a very long time to process because the Databricks Foundation Model endpoints are either:
1. Immediately rejecting requests with rate limit errors
2. Accepting requests but timing out after 30+ seconds without returning a response

## Current Issues

### 1. Rate Limiting
- All Foundation Model endpoints are returning "REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED" errors
- The error message indicates "Queries-per-minute (QPM) rate limit exceeded"
- This affects all available endpoints:
  - databricks-meta-llama-3-1-8b-instruct
  - llama_3_1_70b
  - meta_llama_3_70b_instruct-chat
  - databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct

### 2. Timeout Issues
- When requests are accepted, they hang for 30+ seconds without returning any response
- This causes the application to appear frozen while waiting for LLM responses

## Improvements Implemented

1. **Rate Limit Handling**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff (10s, 20s delays)
2. **Timeout Increase**: Extended timeout from 60s to 120s to give LLMs more time
3. **Endpoint Rotation**: System now tries multiple endpoints automatically
4. **Response Caching**: Added in-memory cache to avoid repeated LLM calls
5. **User-Friendly Errors**: Updated error messages to inform users about rate limits

## Recommendations

### Short-term Solutions:
1. **Wait Between Requests**: Allow at least 60 seconds between document processing attempts
2. **Process in Small Batches**: Limit batch processing to 1-2 documents at a time
3. **Use Off-Peak Hours**: Try processing documents during less busy times

### Long-term Solutions:
1. **Request Rate Limit Increase**: Contact Databricks support to increase QPM limits
2. **Use Private Endpoints**: Deploy dedicated model serving endpoints for your workspace
3. **Implement Queue System**: Add a job queue to process documents asynchronously
4. **Consider Alternative Models**: Explore other LLM providers or smaller models

## Testing Results

- Single document processing: Taking 30-120 seconds when successful
- Batch processing: Extremely slow due to rate limits between documents
- Success rate: Very low due to rate limiting
- All endpoints show similar behavior, indicating workspace-wide limits

## Next Steps

The application is configured correctly and will work when:
1. Rate limits are lifted or increased
2. Foundation Model endpoints become less congested
3. You deploy private model endpoints

For now, the system will show appropriate error messages when LLMs are unavailable, allowing users to understand why processing is slow or failing.
