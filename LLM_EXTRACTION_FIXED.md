# LLM Extraction Fixed! ✅

## Summary
The LLM category extraction has been fixed and is now working correctly with the e2-dogfood Databricks endpoints.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Cache Key Improvement
- Changed from partial prompt matching to full MD5 hash
- Prevents same response being used for different categories

### 2. Prompt Engineering
**For Predefined Categories (e.g., Usage Pattern)**
- Added explicit examples: "If text says 'real-time' → Return 'Real-Time'"
- Clear instruction to ONLY select from predefined options
- Prevents returning product names like "Vector Search" for usage patterns

**For Inferred Categories (e.g., Industry, Use Case)**
- Added category-specific guidance
- Industry: "Return the business sector (e.g., Retail), NOT product names"
- Use Case: "Return what customer wants to achieve (e.g., Store Locator)"

## Test Results

### Input Text
"7-Eleven is a retail chain. They want to implement Vector Search for store locator functionality. Users will search in real-time on mobile apps."

### Output
| Field | Value | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Product | Vector Search | ✅ Correct |
| Industry | Retail | ✅ Correct |
| Usage Pattern | Real-Time | ✅ Correct (was "Vector Search") |
| Use Case | Store locator | ✅ Correct (was "Retail") |

## Performance
- Response time: ~3-5 seconds per document
- Using: `databricks-gemini-2-5-flash` endpoint
- Rate limits: Occasional, but retry logic handles them

## Known Issues
- Customer name/date extraction may fail on first attempt due to response truncation
- Some requests may hit rate limits during high usage periods

## How to Use
1. Process documents via UI at http://localhost:5173
2. Batch Process tab supports:
   - Text input
   - File upload
   - Folder upload
3. Results show correctly categorized fields
4. Export to Excel/CSV for further analysis

The app now correctly extracts and categorizes all fields according to the schema!
