# Final Status - LLM Output Issues

## Current Problem
The LLM is returning incorrect values for categories:
- **Usage Pattern**: Returns "Vector Search" instead of selecting from ["Batch", "Real-Time", "Interactive", "Scheduled"]
- **Use Case**: Returns generic values instead of specific use cases

## Root Causes
1. **Cache Issue**: The cache key isn't specific enough, causing the same response to be returned for different categories
2. **Prompt Clarity**: The LLM isn't understanding that it must select ONLY from predefined options
3. **Gemini Model Behavior**: The model tends to repeat prominent terms from the text rather than analyzing context

## Working Features
✅ Customer name extraction (when present)
✅ Meeting date extraction (when present)
✅ Product identification (correctly identifies "Vector Search")
✅ Industry extraction (correctly identifies "Retail")

## Recommended Fixes

### Option 1: Disable Cache for Testing
```python
# In _query_databricks_model, comment out cache usage
# if cache_key in self._cache:
#   return self._cache[cache_key]
```

### Option 2: Make Cache More Specific
```python
# Include category name in cache key
cache_key = f"{category.name}_{prompt[:100]}_{max_tokens}"
```

### Option 3: Stronger Prompt Engineering
For predefined categories, be extremely explicit:
```
CRITICAL: You can ONLY return these exact values:
- Batch
- Real-Time  
- Interactive
- Scheduled

If the text says "real-time processing", return "Real-Time"
If the text says "interactive usage", return "Interactive"
DO NOT return any other values like "Vector Search"
```

### Option 4: Use Different Model
Try `databricks-claude-3-7-sonnet` which may follow instructions better than Gemini

## Current Workaround
The app is functional but requires manual correction of the extracted values for:
- Usage Pattern
- Use Case

Products and Industries are extracted correctly.
